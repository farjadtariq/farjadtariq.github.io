# How to Host an Online Resume (and learn some fundamentals of Technical Communication along the way)
---


## Purpose
The purpose of this README is to describe how to host an attractive resume on GitHub Pages, whcih is absolutely FREE. The task however is quite simple, so to make this read more worth your while , it'll also give an overview of the concepts of Andrew Etter's bestselling book *Modern Techncical Writing* by relating them to the steps required to host a resume. So cutting the chase, you'll not only learn how to create a fancy technical resume but you'll also learn enough about documentation that you'll sound like a pro in the interviews you get from that resume.

## Audience
The audience for this README is intended to be other CS students like myself. Think of this work as 'by the people for the poeple'. 

## Prerequisites
For this to work: 
- first you need a resume, 
- second your resume needs to be formatted in Markdown. 

If you have a resume already AND it's formatted in Markdown, bravo, you're way ahead of me when I started. If you have a resume, and it's not formatted, worry not, I've not only linked a great Markdown tutorial under "More Resources" at the end of this README, but I'll also be going over what Markdown editor I used to format my resume and then (obviously) show how I hosted it online on GitHub Pages. That's coming up in the next section: **Instructions**.
If you don't have a resume at all however.. then I suggest you make one right away because that's a great step towards gaining employment. 

# Instructions
Now, for the fun part.

### What does Etter say about Technical Writing?
Well, in short, he says 'keep it simple, silly'! 

I mean, come on, you'd expect technical writing to be 'technical' at the very least. However, on the contrary, this type of writing is more based on connecting to the audience rather than just describing the technicalities behind a given process or product. 

Look at this README for example, it's about a computer science student's resume, formatted in a lightweight markup language like Markdown, hosted over a distributed version control system like GitHub, to impress employers looking to employ for highly technical roles. Everything this README is supposed to be explaining screams 'TEHCHNICAL', yet the document itself is anything but that word. 

Apart from keeping it simple, Etter also puts forward the argument that one should adopt lightweight markup languages, use static site generators, and store content in version control repositories with their respective software files. Wait, didn't I talk about that already? He also argues that writers should spend most of their time researching and testing content, investigating analytics, and iterating on the documentation content on their websites. 

### How do I Host my resume on GitHub Pages?
Finally!

#### First things first, How did I format my resume in Markdown?
I used an online free-to-use tool called [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/).
Once you know the basics of Markdown (Remember, tutorial under "More Resources"), it's really as easy as typing text on one side in the tool and seeing that text come to life on the other side showing the live preview.

The GIF above shows a snapshot of the editor while I was writing the statemtents in the above paragraph. Pretty cool I must say!
Anyways, once you're done with the formatting part all you have to do is click on **EXPORT AS** located at the top right corner of the tool and then select Markdown. Next, it will allow you to choose the directory of the folder you want to save the 'Resume.md' (or *whatever*.md) file in. I just chose the same spot on my local drive where I had cloned my repository from GitHub earlier. Oh, and I guess that's the next thing in this README.

#### How do I set myself up on GitHub and Host my resume there?
There are several ways to do this. GitHub at first glance seems like a daunting place to get familiar with. Atleast, I, for one, thought so. So to keep it neat and tidy, I'll only be describing the simple process I used to get set up and carry out the task at hand: Host a resume there. I am not going to go into much detail about how amazing GitHub is or what all the different ways are through which you can carry out the task at hand or how you should totally learn more about it. You *should* learn more about it btw, so I'll include a nice introduction to GitHub under "More Resources". But, as far as our task is concerned GitHub offers a free public repository with each account, this repository is where we will be storing our Markdown formatted resume. From there, using GitHub pages and a tad bit of Jekyll, we will turn it into a easy access webpage. The webpage can be accessed by simply going to the weblink of the public repository you created with GitHub.

##### So, how did I do it?
--
##### How I created a GitHub account
 - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/)
 - Sign Up

##### How I created a public repository
Once you've signed up and are signed in, the left side of your homepage will show a list of your repositories. Since you're a new user it might not show any links to go to but you will see a button saying '**New**' next to where it says repositories, click on it.

Now here, all you have to do is:
- Enter a name: For the sake of this assignment, I suggest using '*yourusername*.github.io'
- Check mark the three points at the end under 'Intialize the repository with': They are for good reason and will only help you
- Click on **Create repository**

And, voila, you now have a public repository.

##### How I uploaded my resume
Now I, took a somewhat longer route here, where I first downloaded [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), logged in using my GitHub login details and chose an option to clone my public repository onto my local drive. This allows me to make changes to my files (like my Markdown formatted resume) locally on my computer without having to worry about having an internet connection. You don't have to do that though.

Going back to when you created your repository through the website. Navigate to the page of your repository if you're not already in it. Once there it won't be hard to spot a button saying **Add file**. Simply click on it, a dropdown menu will appear, click on **Upload files**. In the new page, uploading your Markdown formatted resume should be a breeze, since you can literally drag and drop that stuff. 

And, that's it. You now have a resume uploaded on a public repository that has a weblink to it and you can use it to access a beautiful online resume.
